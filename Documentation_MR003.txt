Name: ±5A Linear Current Sensor
Code: MR003-006.1



   This board carries the Allegro's ACS714ELCTR-05B-T hall effect-based linear current sensor,
which offers a low-resistance (~1.2mΩ) current path and electrical isolation up to 2.1kV RMS.
   The sensor operates at 5V and its analog voltage output has a sensitivity of 185mV/A centered at
2.5V with a typical error of ±1.5% and a 80kHz bandwidth.
   Optimized bidirectional current range is from -5A to +5A, but its robustness allows survival of
the device at up to 5× overcurrent conditions. Top silkscreen shows the direction that is interpreted
as positive current flow.

   The IC has an internal filter resistance of 1.7kΩ, and the carrier board includes a 1nF filter
capacitor, which produces a low-pass RC filter with a 93,6kHz cutoff frequency.
   You can improve sensing system accuracy for low-frequency sensing applictations by adding a
capacitor in parallel with the integrated 1nF capacitor across the component pads labeled as CF.
   The frequency F that the filter will attenuate to half its original power is given by:

  F = 1 / (2πRC) = 1 / (10.68kΩ * (1nF + CF))

  where CF is the value of the capacitor added to the filter pads.
